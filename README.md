# My Firefox CSS Settings

This repository contains custom CSS settings for Mozilla Firefox, originally forked from [MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks](https://github.com/MrOtherGuy/firefox-csshacks).

## Purpose

The main purpose of this repository is to manage my own sets of Firefox browser settings according to personal preferences. While primarily intended for personal use, others are welcome to use or modify under the terms of the Mozilla Public License 2.0.

## Usage

### Installation

To use these custom CSS settings:

1. **Move to your Firefox profile directory:**
   Search `about:profiles` in your Firefox and check 'Root Directory' for your profile location.
   Go into the 'chrome' directory, creating one if it doesn't exist.
2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaajhs/firefox-css.git
   ```
3. **Apply CSS Settings:**
   For the theme to be applied, you should see a userChrome.css file in the 'chrome' folder.
   The master branch does NOT have a default userChrome.css file. See 'Themes' section below.
4. **Restart Firefox:**
   For the change to take effect, Firefox must be restarted completely.

### Themes

Different branches in this repository represent various themes and configurations I've customized. Each branch may contain specific CSS settings tailored to achieve a particular look or functionality.
